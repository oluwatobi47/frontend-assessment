# frontend-assessment
As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a take home assessment.

# Test Specification
Implement the dashboard design as seen on this Figma board (https://www.figma.com/file/fzXDrdFJQ43222TDTND99E/Dashboard-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1).

## About the Design:
It is a single-paged dashboard that prioritizes graph-driven metrics with a dark mode feature.

## Basic Requirement:
- Using dummy values for the graph x and y cordinates, the graph should be interactive and show point metrics as seen on the design
- Circular and horizontal progress bar should work based on inputed dummy data.
- User should be able to toggele between dark and light mode

You'll be assessed based on but not limited to the following:
- Design implementation
- Coding pattern

You can use any language or framework of your choice, but we'd prefer you use either React or Vue.

To complete your homework, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork and when you're done, send relevant details to engineering@shuttlers.ng
You can reach out to david.jaiyeola@shuttlers.ng if you have any questions.
